# FAQ Webpage

This project is a simple FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) webpage, featuring a toggle button functionality that allows users to expand and collapse answers to commonly asked questions. The webpage uses Font Awesome icons for visual indicators (plus and minus signs) to show whether a section is expanded or collapsed.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The webpage is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Expandable/Collapsible Answers:** Each question can be expanded to show the answer and collapsed to hide it.
- **Dynamic Icons:** Plus and minus icons change based on whether the answer is hidden or shown.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the FAQ webpage.
